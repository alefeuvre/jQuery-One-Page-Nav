# jQuery One-Page Nav (without ScrollTo)
A lightweight jQuery plugin for the navigation on one-page sites.
Get original plugin and documentation at http://github.com/davist11/jQuery-One-Page-Nav

I've quickly rewritten it to remove dependencies to ScrollTo and actions on the click.
Only jquery.nav.js is of interest in this repo. Every other files are from the original plugin.

Without scrollTo, remaing parameters are:
<pre>
currentClass: 'current',
filter: '',
scrollOffset: 0,
scrollThreshold: 0.5,
</pre>
